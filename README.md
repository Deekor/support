#Plaid Support#

##Welcome to the Plaid Support Channel

Please submit all questions, issues, and suggestions for the Plaid API in this channel. Documentation is available at https://plaid.io/v2/docs. Docs suggestions are also best made here. 


###General Issues

For most questons, submitting an issue here gets the fastest response. We check this repository many times each day and will work on bugs in order of priority. If your issue is particularly important, please tag it as such.


###Immediate Support

For issues that require immediate support or are sensitive in nature, email us at support@plaid.io. We value a public forum for bugs, fixes, and stupid questions - so please use this option sparingly.
